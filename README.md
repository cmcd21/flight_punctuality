# Analysing UK Flight Punctuality for 2018

Having recently been delayed for over 3 hours when flying to mainland Europe, I researched if there was any compensation available due to my delay. 

Under EU Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to up to â‚¬600 in compensation when their flight lands at their destination more than three hours late. 

I wanted to find out how many more UK flights in 2018 were liable for this compensation whilst also analysing airline reliability and punctuality.

This project extracts, merges, cleans and analyses the monthly data from the Civil Aviation Authority for 2018.
