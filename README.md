# Analysing UK flight punctuality for 2018

Under EU law, passengers may be entitled to compensation if their flight is delayed. I wanted to find out how many flights in 2018 were liable for this compensation whilst also analysis airline reliability and punctuality.

This project merges, cleans and analyses the monthly data from the Civil Aviation Authority for 2018.
