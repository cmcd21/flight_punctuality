# Analysing UK flight punctuality for 2018

Under EU Regulation 261/2004, passengers are entitled to up to €600 (£536) in compensation when their flight lands at their destination more than three hours late. I wanted to find out how many flights in 2018 were liable for this compensation whilst also analysing airline reliability and punctuality.

This project merges, cleans and analyses the monthly data from the Civil Aviation Authority for 2018.
